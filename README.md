# Study and Implementation of Secured LDAP 

> English version is still a work in progress.

This is the [online version of my thesis](http://lzubiaur.github.io/ldap-book/) I wrote back in 2005 during my Computer Science degree.

Originaly written in French using Latex, I ported the project to Markdown and translated it in English in an effort to publish it online hoping it will be useful.
